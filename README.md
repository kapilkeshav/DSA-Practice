# Java-Practice
A repository to hold my progress of learning Java
I am learning Java using W3 Schools. Apart from their exercizes, I also practised Java on hackerrank. Right now I'm solving this gfg page.

# Aim
1) The main reason I'm learning Java is to understand and deepen my understanding of Object-oriented programming.
2) I am finding microservices very interesting. I read that using "Spring boot", which is a framework written in java, we can create them. So, later I would also be learning it.
